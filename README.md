# nodejs-http-server-puppeteer
A simple [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en) http server to illustrate how to use [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) 
to print a pdf of a dynamic url of the map at OpenStreetMap.

There is no other dependency ( we do not use express in this example )


## How to test on your computer

from your favorite shell just type : 

+ git clone https://github.com/lao-tseu-is-alive/nodejs-http-server-puppeteer.git
+ cd nodejs-http-server-puppeteer
+ npm i
+ npm run dev


## requirements 
obviously you need on your computer 
+ a Git client : https://github.com/git-guides/install-git
+ Node.JS : https://nodejs.org/en/download 

## example
![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lao-tseu-is-alive/nodejs-http-server-puppeteer/main/img/screenshot.png)

in the top part of this screenshot you can see a bash shell with  the output of running 

    npm run dev

in the bottom part you have a chrome browser at this url :

http://localhost:5555//print-map/?zoom=17&lon=46.78&lat=6.66

and the resulting pdf that was generated by the code using puppeteer

and you can change the 3 parameter values (zoom, lon and lat )
as you want, to change the resulting map in the pdf

To get a pdf with the map of the beautiful Switzerland just try :

http://localhost:5555//print-map/?zoom=9&lon=46.95&lat=8.12
